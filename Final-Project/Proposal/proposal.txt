idea/proposal for the final project. 

I would like to build a personal portfolio website that is very minimal and simple.
The key to this project would be making viewers to easily browse my portfolio.
I would like to develop this project from Homework Week 1, which already includes a few of my work selects.

I've included a few references in 'reference.img' folder.
I want to have an overall layout following 'reference1.jpg', and 'reference2.jpg'
-display one big image for the top-main image
-have 4 tabs below
-show content of each tabs below the tab navigation bar

tab 1: portfolio
tab 2: about me (if possible, I would like to reference: 'reference-aboutme.jpg')
tab 3: photography
tab 4: personal blog(reference-blogpage)/or maybe linking photos in instagram

-overall, I want to add javascript to make certain icons or content gradually change colors,
when I mouseover, or move around the mouse.
